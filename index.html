    <h1>The Sky</h1>
    <p>
        <pre>
            In hues of dawn, the sky awakes,
            A canvas painted, as morning breaks.
            Golden whispers, sunlight's kiss,
            A symphony of colors, pure bliss.
            
            Nocturnal stars bid their adieu,
            To daylight's reign, a sky so true.
            Clouds dance freely, in soft embrace,
            A celestial ballet, with grace.
            
            Evening falls, a gentle sigh,
            Painting the canvas in twilight's dye.
            Moonlight weaves its silver thread,
            A lullaby for the sky, widespread.
            
            Majestic hues, a cosmic art,
            Stitched by nature, a work of heart.
            The sky, a tale, in every hue,
            A poem written, forever anew.
